== Description ==

This plugin connects different photography related API's to WordPress. It adds certain template tags and short codes but for the most part is meant as a means of communication with the photography sites. Other plugins can then use that information.

For Example: ShootQ integration allows contact forms to send info to ShootQ, using Contact Form 7.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**What is my Pictage Studio ID?**

Log in at Pictage and go to My Account > Manage Studio. It's usually your first and 
last initials, followed by 3 numbers. I.E. AA123

**Some of my Pictage events are not listed, why?**

Be sure the event is set to be "searchable" from "Edit Info & Settings".

**What if I don't want a Pictage event listed?**

Be sure the event is not set to be "searchable" from "Edit Info & Settings".

**Do SmugMug images have to link to the image on SmugMug?**

For now, yes. But they work with the Shadowbox JS plugin, which will make them popup into a nice overlay window so that the user never leaves your site.

**How do I customize the SmugMug gallery?**

All this plugin does is get and display the thumbnail version of the images. You can use your theme's style.css to make them look nicer.

**Does it work with Multisite?**

Yes. This was built for [PhotographyBlogSites.com](http://photographyblogsites.com), which is multisite. The plugin even has a Super Admin level menu that allows Super Admins to enable or disable any of the modules site wide.
